Her letters give a glimpse into her life as she lets him know how their family and farm are faring. In this letter, Sarepta gives Daniel a detailed account of a failed attempt by the Henderson County militia to round up Confederate deserters who were trying to return home. She lists who was killed and injured. There are more deserters than militia in Henderson County.  She wishes she could see Daniel again, and tells him she has moved in with her father."

Wootten was adventurous and unflinching in all aspects of her life, especially business.

She continued to photograph well into her 70s and operated her photo studio in Chapel Hill until 1954.

The orchestration includes violins, viola, trombone, clarinet, flute, drums, and bass. She hoped the song would be adopted as the national anthem, but The Star-Spangled Banner was adopted instead in 1931."
