Revis and his wife Sarepta were farmers in Henderson County. They wrote letters to each other during the Civil War while Daniel served in Co. B, 64th Regt., Infantry, North Carolina Troops. Sarepta did not know how to read or write but had family members help her compose letters to send to her husband while he was away. Her letters give a glimpse into her life as she lets him know how their family and farm are faring. In this letter, Sarepta gives Daniel a detailed account of a failed attempt by the Henderson County militia to round up Confederate deserters who were trying to return home. She lists who was killed and injured. There are more deserters than militia in Henderson County.  She wishes she could see Daniel again, and tells him she has moved in with her father.","United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Health aspects; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Correspondence; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Desertions; Henderson County (N.C.); Women--North Carolina--Social conditions; Confederate States of America--Social conditions; North Carolina--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Sources;","Henderson County, North Carolina, United States",(1860-1876) Civil War and Reconstruction,,,,,The SA of NC considers this item in the public domain by U.S. law but responsibility for permissions rests with researchers.;,Manuscript letter; 2 pages,Daniel W.
